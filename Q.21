To track engagement metrics for two educational institutions on Facebook and Instagram, you would typically analyze:

📈 Likes, Comments, Shares

💬 Post Frequency

🧠 Content Themes

🕒 Time of Posting

🎯 Engagement Rate = (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Followers

🔧 If You Have Pre-downloaded Social Media Data
Assume you have a CSV with columns like:

| platform | institute | date | post_type | likes | comments | shares | followers | caption |

Here's a basic Colab-ready analysis code:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('/content/edu_social_media.csv')

# Convert 'date' to datetime
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# Calculate engagement rate
df['engagement_rate'] = (df['likes'] + df['comments'] + df['shares']) / df['followers']

# Aggregate weekly engagement
df['week'] = df['date'].dt.to_period('W').astype(str)
weekly_engagement = df.groupby(['institute', 'platform', 'week'])['engagement_rate'].mean().reset_index()

# Plot engagement trends
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.lineplot(data=weekly_engagement, x='week', y='engagement_rate', hue='institute', style='platform')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.title("📊 Weekly Engagement Rate Trend (Facebook vs Instagram)")
plt.ylabel("Engagement Rate")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
📌 Key Trends to Observe
Strategy Element	Look For	Interpretation
📅 Post Frequency	High vs Low	More posts might mean more visibility
🔥 Engagement Rate	Which platform drives more?	Instagram usually has better organic reach
🎯 Content Type	Images, Reels, Polls	Videos and reels often have higher engagement
📍 Posting Time	Morning vs Evening	Some times may show consistently higher likes
🧠 Themes	Career, campus, memes, tips	What resonates most with audience

✍️ Sample Insights
Institute A posts more consistently on Instagram and sees higher engagement mid-week.

Institute B performs better on Facebook but posts less frequently.

Visual-heavy content (campus photos, success stories) get the highest reactions.
