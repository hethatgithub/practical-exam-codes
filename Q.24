Here's a full, exam-ready Python script using NetworkX to:

Load Zachary’s Karate Club network (no need to download — it's built-in),

Apply the Girvan–Newman community detection algorithm, and

Visualize and interpret the community splits.

✅ Community Detection with Girvan–Newman

import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from networkx.algorithms.community import girvan_newman
import itertools

# Load the built-in Zachary Karate Club graph
G = nx.karate_club_graph()

# Apply Girvan–Newman algorithm to find communities
comp = girvan_newman(G)
first_level_communities = next(comp)
communities = [list(c) for c in first_level_communities]

# Print detected communities
print("Detected Communities:")
for i, c in enumerate(communities):
    print(f"Community {i + 1}: {sorted(c)}")

# Visualize the communities
color_map = {}
for i, community in enumerate(communities):
    for node in community:
        color_map[node] = i
colors = [color_map[node] for node in G.nodes()]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)
nx.draw(G, pos, node_color=colors, with_labels=True, cmap=plt.cm.Set3, node_size=800, font_weight='bold')
plt.title("Zachary's Karate Club - Girvan–Newman Community Detection")
plt.show()
🔍 Interpretation of the Split:
The Girvan–Newman algorithm removes the edges with highest betweenness iteratively.

This mimics how real communities split — by breaking weak or bridging connections.

In Zachary’s club, this mirrors the real split into two groups due to internal conflict between the instructor and administrator.
